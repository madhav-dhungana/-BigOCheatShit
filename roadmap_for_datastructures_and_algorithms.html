                <h2 class="middle-heading"> Roadmap To Learn DSA From Scratch</h2>
                <p class="body-paragraph">Data structures and algorithms are branches of computer 
                    science that focus on writing efficient and optimized computer programs. Data structure 
                    refers to the organization and storage of data, while algorithms deal with the procedures to achieve desired results or outcomes.
                    
                    
                     </p>
                     <p class="body-paragraph"> The ultimate goal of a software engineer is to write efficient code.
                         Therefore, understanding data structures and algorithms will only make someone a software engineer. 
                         In other words, expertise or deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms makes you a software engineer.
                        
                        
                         </p>
                         <p class="body-paragraph"> If your goal is to innovate or build new things, or to become a computer scientist, 
                            achieving that goal is impossible without knowledge of DSA."
                             </p>
                             <h3 class="body-sub-heading"> Steps to learn DSA</h3>
                            <span class="body-paragraph"> A deep understanding of data structures and algorithms is always 
                                a challenge for aspiring software engineers, and sometimes even seasoned professionals find it difficult.
                                 However, as the saying goes, "It's impossible until it's done."
                                  You may feel frustrated if you don't follow the proper steps to learn, which is why I named this site Big-O Cheat Shit ðŸ˜Š

                            <h4 class="list-sub-heading"> I have broken down the complete process of learning DSA into:</h4>
                            <ol class="list">
                                <li> Be good at at least one Programming language</li>
                                <li> Master the basics of Complexities (Time and Space Complexities)</li>
                                <li> Learn about Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                                <li> Write code, solve DSA chalenges</li>

                            <p class="body-paragraph"> My goal is not to teach you how to write a program; it's all about how to write efficient code, 
                                i.e. Data Structures and Algorithms.
                                 I will explain and implement Data Structures and Algorithms such that a last bencher also grasps the best out of it.
