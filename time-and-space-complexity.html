                <p class="body-paragraph">Once we develop the algorith, what're the parameters to judge the efficiency of algorithm?
                    What happens when our algorithm go working with a collection of 10,000 elements to 10 million? Or 10 billion?
                    
                    
                     </p>
                     <p class="body-paragraph"> 

                        There are two parameters to judge the efficiency of algorithm. 
                        One parameter is running time of the program and another parameter is the space consumed by the program on memory. Which means, 
                        Running time used by the algorith or program is Time Complexity while, space in memory used  or consumed while doing that computation is called Space Complexity.
                        
                        
                         </p>
                         <p class="body-paragraph"> On todays world we have strorage sizes on GB or TB and the program sizes would be on small KBs so the space parameter is not that much 
                            effieicent untill and unless we are running through the sort of storage. But the running time parameter is the important paramenter
                            to judge the efficiency of the algorith. So the time complexity can be used as a proxy for space complexity as well.

                             <h3 class="body-sub-heading"> How to Calculate Time Complexity of a Algorithm?</h3>
                            <p class="body-paragraph"> 

                                We can calulate the time and space taken by any program by running the programm with 
different sizes of data by implementing time checking functions. like this on python :
start = time.time()
print("hello")
end = time.time()
print(end - start)
                            </p>
                            <p class="body-paragraph"> But this approach of the time required for executing a program varies on several environmen, such as: 
                                The number of operations performed and sizes of data size given as input in the program.   </p>

                            <p class="body-paragraph">Different device will have different speed for the computaion of the same program.
                                Data transfer witin medium and devices will vary. Will need to use same set of hardware and software.   </p>

                                <p class="body-paragraph">If we use different hardware to test the algorithm,
                                    then we may get two different time taken by the algorithm. How a algorithm can give two times to run same set of data on different machine?
                                     So, we cannot say this time is globally accepted.
                                    To overcome the limitations of experimental study, we need to go beyond experimental study. And the solution is the use of asymptotic notation.</p>

                            <p class="body-paragraph"> Asymptotic notation is a algebrical method that calculates the required time in terms of input size and independent of the code executiion. </p>
<span> Asymptotic Notation deals with general methodoly for analyzing of running time of the algorithms which uses high level description instead of testing one of its implementation. Asymptotic Notation takes into account of all possible inputs and allows
    one to evaluate the efficiency of any algorithm in a way that is independentof hardware or software environment.</span>

                            <p class="body-paragraph"> The dataset for which maximum time has been taken, we will say worst case of the algorithm. And the dataset for which lowest time

                            <p class="body-paragraph"> The answer is average case. Because we know the probablity of occurance of worst case and best case but what is the probablity of 
                                but what is the probablity to occur average case, , exactly we don't know. Thats why average cas eis more difficult than the best and worst case because it has no 
                                any exact possibility of occurance.

                            <p class="body-paragraph"> Programmers or software engineers frequently engage in prototyping prior to tackling a complex project. 
                                Efficiency may not be a top priority during this stage, as the primary goal is to produce a functional product as quickly as possible. 
                                Eventually, however, it becomes necessary to transition to a deployable implementation of the project idea. At this point, any technical debt 
                                that was ignored during prototyping must be resolved.
                            </p>
                            <p class="body-paragraph"> For this, we need to compare different algorithm or code structure to know how fast or slow our code or algorithm works when
                                the input size of data grows. So, how do you compare the performance of your algorithm or code and determine which one is superior?
                            </p> 

                            <p class="body-paragraph">Here comes Big-O Notation. Big-O Notation is the asymptotic notation approach which help us to know how long the code or algorithm

                             Therefore, take a deep breath, let go of any lingering memories of PreCalc, and enter the realm of Space and Time Complexity with courage. </p>

                             <p class="body-paragraph"> What Big-O Notation isn't? Big O is not going to give you or your team an exact answer on how long a piece of code will take to run.
                                It's crucial to understand that the runtime of algorithms, as denoted by big O notation, does not translate directly to conventional 
                                time units such as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. Big O notation enables us to analyze our code algebraically to gain
                                 insight into its potential performance when faced with significant amounts of data. And, When analyzing running times, certain factors such
                                  as the processor, programming language, or run-time environment are often not considered. 
                                  An approach to understanding time taken is to view it as the count of operations or steps necessary to accomplish a task.
                                  
                                  Once we know the worst case, other cases will be
                                   automatically better
                                 tan this hence on DSA Big-O Notation is analysed to know the performance of any code piece.

                                 The time will increase linearly as the array's element count increases.
                                 That means if an function has to run 10 times for a list thatâs 10 items long, then it has linear time complexity.Such as: <br>
                                 1 Item -> 1 Second <br>

                                        The complexity of the above codebase is linear in the above example since the number of iterations of the for-loop will
                                         be equal to the size of the input items array. For instance, if there are 4 items in the items list, the for-loop will be executed 4 times.

                                                The number of itemsÂ that can be used obviously affects how quickly this algorithm runs.
                                                 It generates precisely n<sup>2</sup> combinations, where n is the total amount of itemsÂ that can be used.
                                                  The code would need to traverse over the array n more times if you added one more item. This method has an O(nÂ²) time complexity.
                                                  The time complexity would be O(n), where n is the number of for loops and l is the total number of items, if you were to add
                                                   more for loops to lengthen the item. For instance, three loops yield an O(n<sup>3</sup>) result, four loops an O(n<sup>4</sup>) result, and so on.
                                                
                                                Code that executes in O(n<sup>2</sup>) should be avoided because adding more components greatly increases the
